# Battleships 

*NOTES*

This is a simple Battleships game. The user can place the ships on the left field, by pressing on an empty cell and selecting the direction and type of the ship. Before the game can begin, the user must place all of the ships and select a battle file (an example is provided in maps.battle). Once the game starts, the user can attack the enemy by clicking on a cell in the enemy field. The game is divided into 15-second rounds during which both the computer and the user have to make a move. The game is over when the user or the computer destroy the other's ships.

*INSTRUCTIONS*

The main function is found in Battleships.java in the src folder. For best results, use an IDE environment such as Eclipse to import the project.
